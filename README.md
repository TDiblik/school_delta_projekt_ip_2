## Notes

Hi, whoever is reading this in the future :D, just wanted to let you know that I wrote this code in 12 hours (additional logic around school_delta_project_ip_1), so it's pretty ugly :/.
I needed to do that because I had other (more important / work related) projects due at the same time. TBH I kinda feel ashamed for this source code, because it's really ugly, but it works and
that's all that matters for the school assignment...
